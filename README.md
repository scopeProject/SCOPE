# Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE)

This repository contains descriptions and background of the SCOPE project. The SCOPE website is located at [https://scopeontology.org](https://scopeontology.org) and the ontology can be explored at [https://ontology.scopeontology.org](https://ontology.scopeontology.org).

The Smart City Ontological Paradigm Expression (SCOPE) was designed as an extension profile to [Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)](https://github.com/ucoProject) and [Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE)](https://github.com/casework/CASE). Both UCO and CASE have been instrumental in laying out the groundwork for a well-specified ontology/model in standardized information representation across the cyber security domain/ecosystem. Although Smart Cities are not yet prevalent, the underlying constructs can be complex, dependent on implemented technology and vendor-specific. A huge amount of effort is expected should digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies extend UCO and CASE, and they likely have to contend with various technologies and systems in the Smart City. 

In our prior work published in [Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/forensic-science-international-digital-investigation) [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2023.301540), we defined Smart Cities in a technology-agnostic manner and referenced key data indicators specified in **ISO37101:2016**, **ISO37120:2018**, **ISO37122:2019** and **ISO37123:2019**. By using these standards, we also align with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) referenced within which allows global compatibility. We further identified possible threats, cybercrime and evidence sources which were used as a basis to extend UCO/CASE to create SCOPE. We hope such an effort can help reduce future workloads by digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies when digital investigations on Smart City Infrastructure are required in future.
